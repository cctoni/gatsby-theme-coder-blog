<PostTitle>Introducing GraphQL Playground</PostTitle>

<Abstract>A powerful GraphQL IDE for better development workflows.</Abstract>

GraphQL is a powerful technology that is revolutionising the way how APIs are designed. Besides its expressiveness when fetching data from a server, another key strength of GraphQL is the [tooling ecosystem](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/3-tooling-and-ecosystem/) around it.

Today, we are excited to introduce a new tool: [**GraphQL Playground**](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground)

### Overview

If you have worked with Prisma before, chances are you have also already seen [an earlier version of the Playground](https://docs-next.graph.cool/reference/basics/console-uh8shohxie#playground), which you can access directly through our web-based Console.

Weâ€™re now going one step further and are making the Playground a [standalone application](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/releases) that you can run locally on your machine.

**Here are some of its core features:**

- Share your Playground on [GraphQL Bin](https://www.graphqlbin.com)
- Improved API documentation
- Code generation, e.g. for [Apollo Client](http://dev.apollodata.com/)
- Access your history of queries and mutations
- Integrates with [graphql-config](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config) and the [graphql-cli](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-cli)

### How is this different compared to GraphiQL?

The GraphQL Playground _is built on top of_ [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) â€”so at the core you can expect similar functionality. However, the Playground offers a lot more features to enable better development workflows!

One of GraphiQLâ€™s most loved features is the out-of-the-box support for accessing the documentation of a GraphQL API. Yet it can be a pain to navigate back and forth inside the single column of GraphiQLâ€™s UI, especially when youâ€™re working with deeply nested types. The Playground now lets you **navigate your API documentation a lot more smoothly**, using multiple columns, and supporting keyboard-based navigation.

![You can browse your API documentation in multiple columns and using the keyboard.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*tAJQaihZZPfTiQZwksMZyQ.gif)_You can browse your API documentation in multiple columns and using the keyboard._

Another issue, particularly in projects with multiple developers, can be that schema changes are introduced _while_ youâ€™re running a GraphiQL session â€” this will break your queries. To prevent this, the GraphQL Playground features an** automatic schema reload** thatâ€™s triggered on any change to your API.

The Playground also ships with other features like support for **GraphQL subscriptions**, using **multiple tabs **to better organise your queries and mutations, **color themes**,\*\* **or exploring your **query history.\*\*

### Sharing your Playgrounds using GraphQL Bin

To improve collaboration in GraphQL projects, we also added the ability for you to easily share a Playground with your fellow developers on [GraphQL Bin](https://www.graphqlbin.com). (Think about it like _Pastebin_ for GraphQL queries.)

![You can share your GraphQL queries (including endpoints & configuration) by sending other a GraphQL Bin link.](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2780/1*BRELKo8NpMCGR3Sr4-vSoA.png)_You can share your GraphQL queries (including endpoints & configuration) by sending other a GraphQL Bin link._

This is a great way to enhance debugging workflows across your team or enable other developers to easily play around with your GraphQL API.

Here is an example bin: [https://graphqlbin.com/RVIn](https://graphqlbin.com/RVIn)

### Embed in your GraphQL Server

Another great feature of the GraphQL Playground is that it allows you to embed it into your own applications, either [as a React component](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground#as-react-component) in your frontend app or on the server-side as [middleware](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground#as-express-middleware) for frameworks such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Hapi](https://hapijs.com/) or [Koa](http://koajs.com/). Here is what the setup for Express looks like:

```js
import express from 'express'
import { express as playground } from 'graphql-playground/middleware'

const app = express()
app.use('/playground', playground({ endpointUrl: '/graphql' }))
app.listen(3000)
```

### Get Involved â€” Roadmap & Upcoming Features

The GraphQL Playground is a great addition to the toolbox of every GraphQL developer. To give you a glimpse whatâ€™s added next, here are some upcoming features:

- _Context-aware_ (history/query-based) autocompletion
- An integrated _Graph View_ based on [GraphQL Voyager](https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager)

GraphQL Playground is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/). Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback, ideas and contributions to improve it even further. ðŸ’š
