<PostTitle>GraphQL SDL — Schema Definition Language</PostTitle>

<Abstract>
  GraphQL has its own language to write GraphQL Schemas: The GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL). SDL is simple and
  intuitive to use while being extremely powerful and expressive.

## What is a GraphQL Schema Definition?

A GraphQL Schema Definition is the most concise way to specify a [GraphQL schema](https://www.prisma.io/blog/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e). The syntax is well-defined and [are part of the official GraphQL specification](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/pull/90). Schema Definitions are sometimes referred to as IDL (Interface Definition Language) or SDL (Schema Definition Language).

The GraphQL schema for a blogging app could be specified like this:

```graphql
type Post {
  id: String!
  title: String!
  publishedAt: DateTime!
  likes: Int! @default(value: 0)
  blog: Blog @relation(name: "Posts")
}

type Blog {
  id: String!
  name: String!
  description: String
  posts: [Post!]! @relation(name: "Posts")
}
```

The main components of a schema definition are the _types_ and their _fields_. Additional information can be provided as custom _directives_ like the `@default` value specified for the `likes` field.

### Type

A type has a name and can implement one or more _interfaces_:

```graphql
type Post implements Item {
  # ...
}
```

## Field

A field has a name and a type:

```graphql
age: Int
```

The GraphQL spec defines some [built-in](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/#sec-Scalars) scalar values but more can be defined by a concrete implementation. The built in scalar types are:

- Int
- Float
- String
- Boolean
- ID

In addition to scalar types, a field can use any other type defined in the schema definition.

Non-nullable fields are denoted by an exclamation mark:

```graphql
age: Int!
```

Lists are denoted by square brackets:

```graphql
names: [String!]
```

## Enum

An `enum` is a scalar value that has a specified set of possible values:

```graphql
enum Category {
  PROGRAMMING_LANGUAGES
  API_DESIGN
}
```

## Interface

In GraphQL an `interface` is a list of fields. A GraphQL type must have the same fields as all the interfaces it implements and all interface fields must be of the same type.

```graphql
interface Item {
  title: String!
}
```

## Schema directive

A directive allows you to attach arbitrary information to any other schema definition element. Directives are always placed behind the element they describe:

```graphql
name: String! @defaultValue(value: "new blogpost")
```

Directives don’t have intrinsic meaning. Each GraphQL implementation can define their own custom directives that add new functionality.

GraphQL specifies built-in skip and include directives that can be used to include or exclude specific fields in queries, but these aren't used in the schema language.
